This is just a simple example for connecting to facebook with OAUTH2.
With this you can do all the reading and writing stuff to facebook.
See the Koala Docs for more.

* Clone the Code
* Run bundle inside the folder
* Copy the sample my_facebook_app.rb adding your own APP_ID, APP_CODE (get this from facebook by registering an app)
